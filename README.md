# Show Pony
Keep your audience focused on what matters.

## Background
This extension was created to help people maintain their audience's focus when presenting a browser window at work or video call or other professional context. 

Most pages have all sorts of information on them. Show Pony allows you to focus your audience on what matters by using a semi-transparent overlay to block everything else out. 

Simply click and drag to draw a transparent window over your content of interest and block everything else out. 

## Supported browsers

Only Chrome is supported at the moment, sorry if you're not a Chrome user. 

## Installation

Two options: 

1. Download from the Chrome Web Store: LINK PENDING

3. Drag any of the corners around as needed without having to re-draw the whole window
